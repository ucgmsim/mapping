            <h2>Q: What are the results presented here based on?</h2>
            <p>A: The values presented are derived from the scientific models developed by Foster et al. (2019) in their research paper “A VS30 Map for New Zealand Based on Geologic and Terrain Proxy Variables and Field Measurements” (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1193/121118eqs281m">https://doi.org/10.1193/121118eqs281m</a>) and subsequent updates. These models are based on various sources of data, including surface geology, topography, and direct Vs30 measurements. The Vs30 values are subject to uncertainties and limitations inherent in the modeling process and the data quality. Users of this Vs30 map should exercise caution and discretion when using the Vs30 values for any purpose and should consult the original paper for more details and explanations.</p>
